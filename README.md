# Custom Programming Language
This template is for you to download in order to make your own coding language. You may fork this template and add to it, if you like. The file extension for this programming language is `.myopl`. The `basic.py` file has support for:

- Parsing
- Lexing
- Binary operations
- Number operations
- Error handling
- Functions
- Mathematical equations
- String/number interpretation
- Nodes, for mathematical equations
- Too much going on I can't even comprehend it

## Downloads

**Make sure that you have Python 3 or above installed in order to use this, as it was coded in Python. Also, make sure you have the required Python debugging extensions for Visual Studio Code. Another thing, make sure to run `shell.py` and not `basic.py` as that is where the running of the language is handled.**
